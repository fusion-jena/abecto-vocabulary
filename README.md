# The ABECTO Vocabulary

The ABECTO Vocabulary (AV) is a vocabulary for the description of execution plans and results of the [ABox Evaluation and Comparison Tool for Ontologies (ABECTO)](https://github.com/fusion-jena/abecto). It reuses â€¦

## Scope of the Vocabulary

The vocabulary is designed to cover the following competency questions.

### Execution Plan

* What are the steps of an execution plan and which steps follow each other in which sequence?
* What is the executing Java class of a step, what are their call parameters and which predefined meta data graph will be used?
* To which dataset belong the resulting primary data of a step?

### Primary Data Graph and Meta Data Graph

  * To which dataset belongs a primary data graph or meta data graph?
  * Which step produced some primary data graph or meta data graph in which time interval and which other data graphs have been used to produces them?

### Aspect

* Which are the aspects of interest?
* What is the key variable of an aspect?
* How is an aspect modeled in a specific dataset?

### Resource Correspondence

* Which resources correspond to each other?
* Which resources are known to not correspond to each other?

### Quality Data

* What object property or data property values of which resource in a dataset are known to be wrong?
* What data property values of which corresponding resources of two dataset deviate?
* What object property values of which corresponding resources that concern the same aspect and of two datasets do not correspond to each other?
* Which further issues have been found for a dataset?
* For which resources in a dataset does no corresponding resource exist in another dataset?
* Which measurements have been measured for a dataset with which parameters?
