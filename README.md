# The ABECTO Vocabulary

The ABECTO Vocabulary (AV) is vocabulary for the description of execution plans and results of the [ABox Evaluation and Comparison Tool for Ontologies (ABECTO)](https://github.com/fusion-jena/abecto). It reuses â€¦

## Scope of the Vocabulary

The vocabulary is designed to cover the following competency questions.

### Execution Plan

* What are the steps of an execution plan and which steps follow each other in which sequence?
* What is the Java class executing a step, what are their call parameters and which predefined meta data graph will be used?
* To which dataset will resulting primary data of a step belong?
* To which dataset belong some primary data?
* Which step produced some meta data or primary data in which time interval and which other data have been used to produces them?

### Categories / Scopes / Domains

*"Category" also used for groups of Quality Dimensions*

* 

### Resource Correspondence / Mapping

* Which resources of which dataset correspond to each other?
* Which resources of which dataset are known to not correspond to each other

### Quality Data

* What object property or data property values of which resource in a dataset are known to be wrong?
* What data property values of which corresponding resources of two dataset deviate?
* What object property values of which corresponding resources in a category of two datasets do not correspond to each other?
* Which further issues have been found for a dataset?
* For which resources in a dataset does no corresponding resource exist in another dataset?
* Which measurements have been measured for a dataset with which parameters?
